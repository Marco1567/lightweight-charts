## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please email our security team at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) with details of the issue. Alternatively, you can use our secure reporting form at https://example.com/security-report.

We aim to acknowledge your report within 2 business days and provide an initial response within 7 business days. We will keep you informed of the progress and may request additional information if necessary.

Once a vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to resolve it as quickly as possible and will notify you when a fix is available. We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have released a fix and coordinated disclosure, if applicable.
